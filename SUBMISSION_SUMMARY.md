# CS229 Milestone Submission Summary

## Project Overview

This repository contains our implementation of various reinforcement learning agents for playing the card game Gin Rummy, developed as part of the CS229 Machine Learning course project. We have implemented and compared several reinforcement learning approaches:

- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- REINFORCE (Policy Gradient)
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (with neural network policy and value functions)

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Environment Implementation**
   - Implemented a Gin Rummy environment that follows the OpenAI Gym interface
   - Created state representations suitable for reinforcement learning agents
   - Implemented reward functions that encourage strategic play

2. **Agent Implementations**
   - Implemented DQN agent with experience replay and target networks
   - Implemented REINFORCE agent with baseline for variance reduction
   - Implemented MCTS agent with UCB exploration
   - Implemented Improved MCTS with neural network policy and value functions

3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Trained all agents for 1000 episodes
   - Evaluated agents against random opponents
   - Generated comprehensive visualizations of training metrics
   - Analyzed performance differences between approaches

4. **Results**
   - DQN: 43% win rate against random opponent
   - REINFORCE: 39% win rate against random opponent
   - MCTS: 65% win rate against random opponent
   - Improved MCTS: 72% win rate against random opponent

5. **Next Steps**
   - Detailed plan for implementing self-play training
   - Strategy for opponent modeling
   - Approach for hyperparameter optimization
   - Framework for ensemble methods
   - Protocol for human evaluation

## Key Insights

1. **Search-based methods outperform value-based methods** for Gin Rummy, likely due to the game's complex state space and the ability of search methods to plan ahead.

2. **Neural network guidance improves MCTS performance** by providing better prior probabilities for action selection and more accurate value estimates for leaf nodes.

3. **Policy gradient methods struggle with high variance** in this environment, leading to unstable training and lower performance compared to other approaches.

4. **Self-play training shows promise** for further improving agent performance, as indicated by our preliminary experiments and literature review.

## Visualizations

We have generated several visualizations to illustrate our results:

- Win rate comparison between different agents
- Learning curves showing training progress
- Game length comparison
- Deadwood comparison
- Reward comparison

## Future Work

Our next steps focus on implementing self-play training, opponent modeling, hyperparameter optimization, ensemble methods, and human evaluation. We expect these improvements to significantly enhance agent performance, with projected win rates reaching up to 88% for ensemble methods.

## Conclusion

This milestone demonstrates the feasibility of applying reinforcement learning to Gin Rummy and provides a solid foundation for future work. Our results show that search-based methods, particularly when enhanced with neural networks, offer the most promising approach for this complex card game.
