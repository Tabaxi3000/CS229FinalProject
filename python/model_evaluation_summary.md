# Gin Rummy Model Evaluation Summary

## Issue Identification

We identified an issue where all games in the evaluation are ending in draws after reaching the maximum turn limit (100 turns). Upon investigation, we found that this is due to how different models predict actions:

### Action Distribution Analysis

| Model | Draw Stock | Draw Discard | Knock | Gin | Discard |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------|-----|---------|
| REINFORCE-Enhanced-Best | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| DQN-Enhanced-Best | 0.0% | 0.0% | 20.0% | 0.0% | 80.0% |
| REINFORCE-Quick-Final | 0.0% | 1.0% | 0.0% | 1.0% | 98.0% |
| DQN-Quick-Final | 0.0% | 0.0% | 8.8% | 3.5% | 87.7% |

As we can see, the REINFORCE-Enhanced-Best model (which is considered our best model) only predicts "Draw Stock" actions and never predicts "Knock" or "Gin" actions, meaning games never end naturally.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Retrain the REINFORCE model**: Modify the training process to encourage the model to predict "Knock" and "Gin" actions. This could involve:
   - Adding a reward bonus for ending games
   - Creating more training examples where knocking or gin is the optimal action
   - Using a curriculum learning approach where the model is first trained to recognize good knocking opportunities

2. **Use DQN models for gameplay**: The DQN models (DQN-Enhanced-Best and DQN-Quick-Final) do produce Knock and Gin actions, so they could be used for gameplay.

3. **Modify the evaluation framework**: We could modify the evaluation to detect when a player has a hand with low deadwood (â‰¤ 10) and force a knock action, which would better simulate real gameplay.

4. **Combined model approach**: We could create a hybrid approach where the REINFORCE model is used for most decisions, but a rule-based system is used to determine when to knock or declare gin.

## Implementation Plan

1. First, update the ModelPlayer class in evaluate_gameplay.py to check for low deadwood counts in the player's hand before asking the model for an action. If the deadwood is below the threshold, force a knock or gin action.

2. Create a new training script that specifically focuses on teaching the models when to knock or declare gin.

3. Run the enhanced evaluation again with these changes to see if we get more meaningful game results.

4. Consider retraining the REINFORCE model with a modified reward structure that encourages game-ending actions.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the deadwood check in the ModelPlayer class
2. Re-run the evaluation with this modification
3. If results are still not satisfactory, create a specialized training script for knocking/gin actions
